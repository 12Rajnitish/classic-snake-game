# Classic Snake Game

## Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python's `turtle` graphics module. The game involves controlling a snake that grows longer each time it eats food while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls.

## Features
- The snake moves and grows longer when it eats food.
- The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the wall.
- A scoreboard displays the current score at the top of the screen.
- The player can control the snake's movement using the arrow keys.

## Files
1. `main.py`: Contains the main game loop, controls, and game logic.
2. `scoreboard.py`: Defines the ScoreBoard class to manage the score display.
3. `snake.py`: Contains the Snake class to manage the snake's behavior and movement.
4. `food.py`: Defines the Food class to manage food generation and relocation.
